# ContosoPizza üçï
 
- API to Create, Read, Update, and Delete Pizzas <br>
- Data persistency with Entity Framework and SQLite <br>
- Concepts review purpose <br>

## Build and test the web API

### Run the API:
```
dotnet run
```

### Testing with Swagger: <br>

1. In the output that appears after you run the app, find the HTTP URL where the app listens. The output looks similar to the following example:

```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5200
```

2. To open the URL, select it while holding Ctrl. The browser opens to the / location for the API, which returns the text Contoso Pizza management API. Go to /swagger to open the Swagger test UI.

3. In the browser's address bar, add /swagger to the end of the URL and select Enter.
